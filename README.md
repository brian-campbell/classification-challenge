## Run the code
Assuming a python interpreter is installed and is at least version 3.10 or greater and they jupyter notebook runtime, the program can be executed by calling the jupyter notebook runtime in the directory: E.g., $> jupyter notebook. Once the notebook is running you run each code fragment individually or click on the "Run All" button.

Alternatively it can be executed from within and IDE if the IDE is configured to run python code and is at least 3.10 compatible and a jupyter notebook runtime is installed.
