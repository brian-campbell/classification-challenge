## Overview

## Background

## Files

## Technical requirements
The code for the Challenge is in `spam_detector.ipynb`. This file is a Jupyter Notebook and requires an appropriate jupyter, pandas, and python tooling installed. This can include environmental containers such a anaconda, etc. It can also be executed inside of an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. The code requires python 3.10 or greater.

The file `spam_detector_orig.ipynb` is the original starter file provided for the challenge. It is part of the project for reference only. 


## Run the code
Assuming a python interpreter is installed and is at least version 3.10 or greater and they jupyter notebook runtime, the program can be executed by calling the jupyter notebook runtime in the directory: E.g., $> jupyter notebook. Once the notebook is running you run each code fragment individually or click on the "Run All" button.

Alternatively it can be executed from within and IDE if the IDE is configured to run python code and is at least 3.10 compatible and a jupyter notebook runtime is installed.
