## Overview
This repository contains the source code for the OSU AI Bootcamp classification challenge for Module 13. This challenge focuses classifying email as spam or not spam.


## Background
For this challenge, we were asked to assume the role of a resource who works at an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and we've been tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers. We've been provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP wants me to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

We created two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluated which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models we created were a logistic regression model and a random forest model.

## Files
This repository contains four files:
* `spam_detector.ipynb` - the file that contains the solution for the challenge. This is a Jupyter Notebook.
* `spam_detector_orig.ipynb` - the original starter file for the challenge. This is for reference only.
* `README.md` - a README file for the repo.

## Technical requirements
The code for the Challenge is in `spam_detector.ipynb`. This file is a Jupyter Notebook and requires an appropriate jupyter, pandas, and python tooling installed. This can include environmental containers such a anaconda, etc. It can also be executed inside of an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. The code requires python 3.10 or greater.

The file `spam_detector_orig.ipynb` is the original starter file provided for the challenge. It is part of the project for reference only. 


## Run the code
Assuming a python interpreter is installed and is at least version 3.10 or greater and they jupyter notebook runtime, the program can be executed by calling the jupyter notebook runtime in the directory: E.g., $> jupyter notebook. Once the notebook is running you run each code fragment individually or click on the "Run All" button.

Alternatively it can be executed from within and IDE if the IDE is configured to run python code and is at least 3.10 compatible and a jupyter notebook runtime is installed.
